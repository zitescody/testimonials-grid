### What I learned

I further learned how to create a responsive webpage based on preselected media queries. In this example, The text and size of boxes move with the resizing of the screen.

```css
:root {
    /* Primary Colors */
    --moderateviolet: hsl(263, 55%, 52%);
    --verydarkgrayishblue: hsl(217, 19%, 35%);
    --verydarkblackishblue: hsl(219, 29%, 14%);
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);

    /* Neutral Colors */
    --lightgray: hsl(0, 0%, 81%);
    --lightgrayishblue: hsl(210, 46%, 95%);

    /* 
    1. "Verified Graduate" has the same color as the person's name with 50% opacity
    2. Review paragraphs inside the quotations have the same color as well, but are at 70% opacity
    */
}
```
```css
/* Grid Styles */
div.container-one {
    grid-column-start: second;
    grid-column-end: third;

        ;
        row-gap: 20px;
        column-gap: 20px;
    }
}
```
### Continued development

I had trouble keeping the text within the boundaries of the boxes. Sometimes there was overflow. Hiding it did not solve my problem for then the text would not be seen.
